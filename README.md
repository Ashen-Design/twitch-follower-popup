# Twitch Follower Popup
A minimalistic follower popup alert to be used on [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com).

# How to use?
Set up an alert profile on Streamlabs for the follower, and make sure to check 'Use Custom HTML'.
Once you have done this, you will be three tabs. One for HTML, one for CSS and another for JS.

Copy the code from the respective files in this github repository and modify to your liking.

This project supports images and sounds from Streamlabs' interface, so no need to link your own ones via links.
